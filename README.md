# diceware-wordlist-bg
Initial inspiration came from https://theworld.com/~reinhold/diceware.html#Diceware%20in%20Other%20Languages|outline
Did not like the fact that the Bulgarian list was only in PDF format with text not select-able, great for printing but not for playing with it,
so decided to reuse the Bulgarian word list from https://github.com/aquilax/bg-words-dict and build my own.
Wanted to experiment also with the process of building such a list.
Luckily Linux provides all the tools you need out of the box.
Tools used:
grep
awk
wc
shuf
cat
paste
and lots of less :)
